My goal is to create the perfect place for people to share stories they write, discuss fiction/fanfiction, and help each other to get better at writing.

Project is in active development. This is a very early version, not even alpha yet, just a prototype.

# To Contributors
If you want to contribute to this project and make it more awesome, here's what you can do:

- First and foremost - feedback, ideas, and bug reports.
  At this point I'm actively refactoring code, so it will be hard to make a meaningful contribution on the backend, but you can use the website and write me your thoughts about it or suggest new features to raymestalez@gmail.com - I will be very grateful =)
- If you are a javascript person - consider forking [this editor](https://github.com/lepture/editor) and figuring out how to make it work well on mobile.
